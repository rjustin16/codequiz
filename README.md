## Code Quiz
I made a code quiz with 5 questions that lasts 75 seconds. With each question answered correctly the user gains a point, but with each question answered incorectly the user loses 10 points. The time remaining in the game is then added to the users final score. If the user runs out of time then the quiz is ended and no time is added to their score. At the end of the game your score is displayed and you have an option to play again.
